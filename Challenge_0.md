# Scenario 1

## Scenario: Imagine your class raises money for a good cause each month. You have a list of how much money (a number) you raised in each month of the year. 

### How can you figure out which month raised the most money? 

You could write down variables for each month, such as Jan, Feb, Mar, etc. Then you can place an equal sign and give the number (for example Feb = 23). After this you can easily see what month raised the most money. 

### What steps would you take to use and organise these numbers to find the answer?
First I would write out each month as variables using the first three letters of the month. Then i'd write in the stats for each of the twelvge months, and use max value code to group the variables together and find the biggest number/


# Scenario 2

## Scenario: Your class is choosing between two field trips: a museum or a zoo. The class votes on the options (each student picks one). 

### How would you organise and use the voting results (the number of votes for each option) to decide which trip is more popular? 

I'd create a poll on Google Forms that the class could answer in classtime that has two options: museum or a zoo. Alternatively, a table could be created that has the names of each student and then true/false for each one. True could be the museum and false could be the zoo.

### What information would you compare to evaluate the best choice for the class?

I would compare the results of the two different options and see what the bigger number (therefore most people that voted) was. Then the choice would be made of the bigger integer.

# Scenario 3

## Scenario: You are planning a class party.

###  What data would you collect to help plan (for example, the number of people coming, each person's favorite snack, and if anyone has an allergy yes/no)? 

Google Sheets is one of the best platforms for cataloguing data, so I'd create a new sheet and list every person coming. Since each person is organised to a row, I can count the amount of people coming. I can create a row for each person's favourite snack, and have a yes/no row for allergies.

### How would you organise this information to decide how much food and drink to get and make sure everyone has something they can enjoy?

If there is a recurring food or drink, I will choose the top three for four most common of that particular caliber. This would allow the max amount of people to bew satisfied with their requests. Alternatively, an extra table could be created for their second preferences, or they had to choose out of a select few snacks and drinks.

# Scenario 4

## Scenario: Your teacher has one list of students with perfect attendance and another list of students with top grades. Both lists are names (text data). 

### How could you put these two lists together to find out which students are on both lists? 

Create a new list with both students with perfect attendance AND students with top grades next to them in a table format. After writing down the students' names alphabetically, the people who have perfect attendance or top grades are shaded in green in the respective boxes.

### Why would it help to organise the names clearly (for example, alphabetically or in a table) when looking for students that appear in both sets of data?

It would help organise the names as the the greens stand out quite alot, and since the rows are next to each other, it's easy to find two green squares next to each other.

# Scenario 5

## Scenario: Imagine a toy ad says, "90% of kids love this toy!" You find out they only asked 10 kids and 9 said they loved it (yes). 
 
### What might be wrong or unfair about this data? 

There are many issues about this. First of all, 10 kids does not even show a fraction of the child population, and perhaps these kids are of a select few that had been specifically chosen. The kids may also be of the same age, which have been proven to have more common interests than kids from different ages.

### What questions would you ask before believing the adâ€™s claim (for example, Is 10 kids a big enough sample? Did they ask a fair mix of different kids?)? 

I'd ask myself how interesting this toy was to be true, ask myself the data of the kids (their age, race, lifestyle etc). The main question though would be how this is such a round number and how many kids were surveyed.

### Explain why you would or wouldn't trust this claim based on the data.

If only 10 kids are being surveyed, it accounts for a very minimal percentage of kids in general and paints a biased picture that these kids may have different personalities, backgrounds and most importantly, ages.

# Scenario 6

## Scenario: Imagine you want to get everyone to read more books by holding a fun contest at school. Think of a creative way to use data in this contest. For example, you could track how many pages or books each class reads (numbers) or have students vote for their favorite book (yes/no votes or a list of titles). 

### What data would you collect?

I'd collect how many of each genre is read (for example Sci-Fi and Romance) and by the end, the genre with the most books read would win and their section would get a massive improvement of books.

### How would you use it to make the reading contest both fair and exciting?

I'll make sure that there are an equal number of books per genre (possibly 15 - 20 per genre). I'll also make sure that the genres are explicitly mentioned (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Romance, Mystery, Thriller, Horror, Historical, Comedy) so that people don't go reading books from all different genres accidentally. This will allow the system to be quite fair (though it will always be slightly unfair as certain people are faster readers or more people are reading one genre). It'll be fun since reading is quite entertaining and it'll be a race to see what genre is the best, which allows people to use persuasion to recruit others to their genre, or one person can carry their genre and read dozens of books.

There could also be a prize for the person that reads the most books, such as a $50 Dymocks voucher to give more reason to compete.
